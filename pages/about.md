    <!-- About Text -->
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a researcher-turned-data scientist with a passion for uncovering hidden insights in everyday data about people 
      and transforming them into stories that matter. At its heart, this passion stems from my curiosity about the diverse 
      perspectives that shape how people perceive the world. What began with studying psychology and economics to explore 
      individual and societal behavior led me to pursue a PhD in Behavioral Science (Marketing). Now, I'm eager for my 
      next challenge -- building models that can create tangible and meaningful impact (something that I thought was lacking 
      in graduate research).

      When I'm not deep in datasets or pondering human behavior, I'm appreciating the small but beautiful moments in life: 
      the allure of late-night R&B, the harmony of a perfect food and wine pairing, and the combined indignation of my friends 
      and I over a missed foul call on Lebron James.
